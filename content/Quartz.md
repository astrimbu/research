[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is a **static-site generator** created by [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)

**SSGs** are a nice tool for:
- managing web content
- generating webpages
- implementing templates

I recommend giving the [Philosophy of Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy) a read.

[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is *rhizomatic*, as opposed to *arborescent*  


The concept of a "digital garden", as opposed to traditional hierarchical systems, embraces the non-linear and interconnected nature of human thought. It allows for the creation of new paths and meanings through a web-like structure, encouraging creativity and unexpected relationships between ideas.
### Misc notes for me
`npx quartz build --serve`  
`npx quartz sync`
`taskkill /F /IM node.exe`
