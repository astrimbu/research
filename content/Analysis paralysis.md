title: Analysis paralysis
aliases:
  - Overthinking
---

Analysis paralysis is when the fear of either making an error or forgoing a superior solution outweighs the realistic expectation or potential value of success in a decision made in a timely manner.  

This imbalance results in suppressed decision-making in an **unconscious effort to preserve existing options**.  

An overload of options can overwhelm the situation and cause this "paralysis", rendering one unable to come to a conclusion.  

It can become a larger problem in critical situations where a decision needs to be reached, but a person is not able to provide a response fast enough, potentially causing a bigger issue than they would have had, had they made a decision.

Casual analysis paralysis can occur during the process of trying to make personal decisions if the decision-maker overanalyzes the circumstance with which they are faced.  

When this happens, the sheer volume of analysis overwhelms the decision-maker, weighing him or her down so much they feel overwhelmed with the task and is thus unable to come to a rational conclusion.  

Such a circumstance is more formally known as **cognitive distortion**.  

Dwelling is overthinking.
