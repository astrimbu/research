**"Critique of Pure Reason"** is one of the most influential works in Western philosophy, written by Immanuel Kant.  

The book seeks to answer two central questions:  

What can we know?  and  
How can we know it?  

#### Main Themes:

- **Transcendental Idealism**
    - our experience of things is about how they appear to us (phenomena)
	    - not about those things as they are in themselves (noumena)

- **A Priori and A Posteriori Knowledge**
    - a priori knowledge - knowledge independent of experience
	    - mathematics
    - a posteriori knowledge - knowledge dependent on experience
	    - empirical observations

- **Analytic and Synthetic Judgments**
    - analytic judgments - truth based on definitions / logic
	    - "All bachelors are unmarried"
    - synthetic judgments - new information
	    - "The cat is on the mat"

- **Categories of Understanding**
    - the mind has innate structures or categories (such as causality, unity, plurality) that it uses to organize sensory input into coherent experiences.

- **The Copernican Revolution in Philosophy**
    - objects conform to our knowledge rather than our knowledge conforming to objects.
    - This shift in perspective is often compared to the Copernican revolution in astronomy.

- **Limits of Human Knowledge**
    - while we can know phenomena, we cannot know the noumena or things-in-themselves.

#### Impact:

- foundational for much of modern philosophy, influencing subsequent thinkers and shaping discussions in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics.
- ideas about the limits of human knowledge and the active role of the mind in shaping experience have had a lasting impact.
