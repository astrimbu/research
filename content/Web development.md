Web development is great.  
You can just put stuff on the Internet.  
Like this: 🍕❗

I'm currently practicing my JavaScript (and my prompting - thanks Claude), learning new [[React]] principles (note on `useReducer` coming soon), wasting time customizing my IDE ([[Neovim]] is 😎), and just increasing the # of (good?) projects on [my website](https://alan.computer).

Anyway, things to add:  
- [ ] Node, npm
- [ ] Vite
- [ ] JavaScript, JSX
- [ ] HTML/CSS
- [x] [[React]]
- [x] [[Neovim]]
