Web development is great.  
You can put stuff on the Internet.  
Example: üçï  

I'm currently learning new [[React]] concepts by coding a [Mini RPG](https://alan.computer/coinflip), and wasting time customizing my development environment ([[Neovim]] is very fun).  

Things to discuss:  
- [ ] JavaScript, JSX
- [ ] HTML/CSS
- [ ] Node.js - *JavaScript runtime environment* 
- [ ] npm - *default Node.js package manager*
- [ ] Vite - *React project templates*
- [x] [[React]]
- [x] [[Neovim]]
