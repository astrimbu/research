Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" rather than "continuous". The branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets.  

Objects studied in discrete mathematics include:  
- integers
- graphs
- statements in logic

By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as  
- real numbers
- calculus
- Euclidean geometry

Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers.
