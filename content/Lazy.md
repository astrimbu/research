Laziness, often characterized by  

> a **lack of motivation** to engage in **effortful activities**,  

can be influenced by learned behaviors and cognitive factors.  

### Causes

1. **Learned Helplessness**:
    - Repeated uncontrollable/challenging situations -> a sense of helplessness
    - Learned helplessness -> reduce motivation, increase passivity -> laziness
2. **Reward Systems**:
    - minimal effort -> acceptable rewards
	    - ∴ conditioned to exert less effort -> laziness
3. **Self-Efficacy**:
    - Albert Bandura's *theory of self-efficacy*
	    - believing in one’s ability to succeed
		    - belief in one's capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments
		- reflects confidence in the ability to exert control over one's own
			- motivation,
			- behavior, and
			- social environment.
    - Low self-efficacy -> avoidance of effortful tasks -> laziness
4. **Habit Formation**:
    - Repeated behaviors -> habits
    - Habitually avoid effortful activities -> laziness
5. **Cognitive Dissonance**:
    - Mismatched beliefs ≠ behaviors -> reduce motivation - laziness
	    - (e.g., believing hard work is important but not engaging in it)


### Strategies to Overcome Laziness

1. **Setting Goals**:
    - Specific, challenging-yet-achievable goals -> increased motivation.
    - Clear, short-term goals -> direction and a sense of accomplishment.
2. **Incremental Change**:
    - Gradual increases in effortful activity can help build habits.
3. **Positive Reinforcement**:
    - Reward effort and achievement -> reinforce hard-working behaviors
	    - intrinsic reward (sense of satisfaction)
	    - extrinsic reward (tangible rewards)
4. **Self-Efficacy**:
    - Self-efficacy enhances motivation:
	    - mastery experiences (success in tasks)
		- social modeling (observing others succeed)
		- verbal persuasion (positive encouragement)
5. **Cognitive Restructuring**:
    - Change the narrative:
	    - ~~“I can’t do this”~~ -> *“I can improve with practice”*
6. **Addressing Underlying Issues**:
    - Sometimes laziness is a symptom of:
	    - depression
	    - anxiety
	    - burnout
	- Address root causes through examination or lifestyle changes
7. **Creating an Environment Conducive to Productivity**:
    - Structured, distraction-free environment -> increased focus, reduced procrastination
    - Use tools:
	    - to-do lists
	    - planners
	    - time management techniques (e.g. Pomodoro)
8. **Mindfulness and Self-Regulation**:
    - Mindfulness meditation -> improved self-regulation
	    - Helps you stay focused and resist the temptation to avoid effortful tasks


### Other

- **Neuroplasticity**:
	- The brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.
	- Engaging in new, effortful activities can strengthen the neural pathways associated with motivation and hard work.

- **Motivational Systems**: 
	- `dopaminergic system` × `prefrontal cortex`
		- `reward` × `planning and decision-making`
	- Strategies that enhance the perceived value of effortful tasks can engage these systems more effectively.
