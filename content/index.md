Welcome to my notebook / second brain / digital garden / blog / wiki.

My goal is to store a bunch of my knowledge / research here in markdown format.

Tools used are [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for editing content, [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for SSG, GitHub Pages for hosting.

## Focus areas: ‚úçÔ∏è(‚óî‚ó°‚óî)
- [[Computer Science]]
- [[NLP]]
- [[LLMs]]
- [[Stable Diffusion]], [[AI Art]]
- [[Piano]]

## Info dump: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ üß†
- [[Research Papers]]
- [[Piano Repertoire]]
- [[Disc Golf]]

Some random notes for maintaining this site:
1. Avoid vague notes
2. Avoid notes you won't use again
3.
