Goals for today:  
- [x] [[AI Syllabus]]
- [ ] Progress on "Old incomplete"

---

I'd like to close some knowledge gaps I have in AI.  
My goal is to have a deep understanding of how AI projects work.  
I'll focus on foundational math/cs first, then move on to ML and AI concepts.  
I'll be using many different resources:
- Open courseware e.g. MIT, Stanford
- Books, textbooks
- Personal notes
- Other online sources
### AI Learning Plan

Karpathy's advice on learning:  
Avoid snacks - "Learn XYZ in 10 minutes"  
Seek the meal - textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform  
	read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn  

1. Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth-wise, learning "on demand"  
2. Teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words  
3. Only compare yourself to younger you, never to others
