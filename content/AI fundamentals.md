~~"Learn XYZ in 10 minutes"~~  

Read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase:  
	textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform  

1. Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth-wise, learning "on demand"  
2. Teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words  
3. Only compare yourself to younger you, never to others
