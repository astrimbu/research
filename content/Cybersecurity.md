Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Key aspects of cybersecurity include:  

1. **Information Security**: Protecting data from unauthorized access and ensuring data privacy and integrity.
2. **Network Security**: Securing a computer network infrastructure from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
3. **Application Security**: Focusing on keeping software and devices free of threats, requiring security to be built into the applications themselves.
4. **Endpoint Security**: Protecting end-user devices like computers, mobile devices, and other endpoints from malicious threats.
5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access specific resources and information.
6. **Data Security and Encryption**: Protecting data in transit and at rest by using encryption and other methods to prevent unauthorized access.
7. **Incident Response and Recovery**: Developing and implementing plans to respond to cybersecurity breaches, mitigate damage, and recover from the attack.
8. **Compliance and Risk Management**: Ensuring that an organization adheres to laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and managing the risk associated with cyber threats.

Cybersecurity involves the implementation of security measures across various layers of an organization's IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, networks, and data. The goal is to create a comprehensive defense strategy to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.
