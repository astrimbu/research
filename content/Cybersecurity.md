Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.  

1. **Information Security**: Protecting data from unauthorized access and ensuring data privacy and integrity.
2. **Network Security**: Securing a computer network infrastructure from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
3. **Application Security**: Focusing on keeping software and devices free of threats, requiring security to be built into the applications themselves.
4. **Endpoint Security**: Protecting end-user devices like computers, mobile devices, and other endpoints from malicious threats.
