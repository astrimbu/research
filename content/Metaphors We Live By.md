title: Metaphors We Live By
---
"Metaphors We Live By" (1980) is a seminal book by linguist George Lakoff and philosopher Mark Johnson that explores the role of metaphors in shaping our understanding of the world.  

1. Metaphors are not just figures of speech
2. Conceptual metaphors underlie our understanding of abstract concepts
	- e.g. Conduit metaphor
		- People write as if they *"insert"* their mental contents (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts) into *"containers"* (words, phrases, sentences) whose contents are then *"extracted"* by listeners and readers.
		- Thus, language is viewed as a *"conduit"* conveying mental content between people.
3. Metaphorical thought is pervasive

By recognizing the role of metaphors in shaping our understanding, Lakoff and Johnson suggest that we can gain a deeper appreciation for how language influences our perceptions. Metaphors are not just decorative devices but rather fundamental tools for constructing meaning and understanding.
