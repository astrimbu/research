A fungus is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar [[Mushroom|mushrooms]].  

These organisms are classified as one of the traditional eukaryotic kingdoms, along with Animalia, Plantae and either Protista or Protozoa and Chromista.  

- A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is **chitin** in their cell walls.
	- Chitin is the second most abundant [[Polysaccharide|polysaccharide]] (long-chain polymeric [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]]) in nature (behind only cellulose).
		- The cellulose content of...
			- cotton fiber is 90%
			- wood is 40â€“50%
			- dried hemp is 57%.
	- The fungal cell wall is made of a chitin-glucan complex; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall.
	- Unlike those of plants and oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.

Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment.
