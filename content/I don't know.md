title: I don't know

On the first day of my [[Discrete mathematics|discrete math]] class, my professor waxed poetic about something:  

>If you don't know, you should say "I don't know."  

He repeated this all the time.

Saying "I don't know" can help you avoid overconfidence, and remain open to new information and perspectives.  

When nobody is willing to admit that they don't know something, it becomes difficult to know who to trust, and what the truth really is.
