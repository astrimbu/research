**"Meditations on First Philosophy"** is a foundational work in Western philosophy by Ren√© Descartes (1641). It consists of six meditations in which Descartes seeks to establish a firm foundation for scientific knowledge by doubting all beliefs that can be called into question.

1. **First Meditation: Of the Things Which We May Doubt**
    - Descartes begins by considering the falsehoods he has believed and the doubts he has about the reliability of his senses. He resolves to discard all opinions that are not absolutely certain.
2. **Second Meditation: Of the Nature of the Human Mind; and that It Is More Easily Known than the Body**
    - In the second meditation, Descartes establishes his famous dictum, "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"). He argues that while he can doubt the existence of everything, he cannot doubt his own existence as a thinking being.
3. **Third Meditation: Of God; That He Exists**
    - Descartes presents arguments for the existence of God. He reasons that the idea of a perfect being must have originated from a perfect being, thus proving God's existence.
4. **Fourth Meditation: Of Truth and Error**
    - Descartes examines the nature of truth and error, concluding that error arises not from God, but from the human faculty of judgment when it is misused.
5. **Fifth Meditation: Of the Essence of Material Things; and, Again, of God; That He Exists**
    - In this meditation, Descartes further discusses the essence of material things and reinforces his argument for the existence of God. He also introduces the idea that the existence of material objects is certain because God, who is not a deceiver, would not allow him to be deceived about this belief.
6. **Sixth Meditation: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction between the Soul and the Body**
    - Finally, Descartes discusses the existence of material things and the distinction between the mind and body. He concludes that the mind and body are distinct substances, but they interact with each other.

**Overall Contribution:**  
- Descartes' "Meditations" laid the groundwork for modern philosophy, particularly in epistemology and metaphysics. His method of doubt and emphasis on the thinking self as the foundation of knowledge influenced many subsequent philosophical developments.
